# Disease: Marfan syndrome
Marfan Syndrome is an autosomal disorder (only need one copy to develop the condition) that affects the skeletal, ocular, and   cardiovascular systems. Here is a breakdown of what it does within each of these systems:
* Skeletal - scoliosis, chest wall deformity, tall stature, abnormal joint mobility
* Ocular - ectopia lentis - condition characterized by the displacement or malposition of the eye's crystalline lens from its normal location. It can range from a partial dislocation (lens subluxation) to a complete dislocation (lens luxation), almost always bilateral in MFS
* Cardiovascular system - progressive dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, causes aortic incompetence and dissection; Leading cause of premature death in MFS

Symptoms of this disease include:

Treatments of this disease include:
* Beta-blockers: considered the first-line medication for patients with this disease
* Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs): Losartan and ARBS can reduce aortic root dilation more than beta-blockers alone
* Surgery: Prophylactic aortic root surgery to prevent aortic dissection or rupture by repairing or replacing the mitral valve 
* Ophthalmological Management: Regular eye exams and interventions for lens dislocation or retinal detachment 1
* Orthopedic Management: Treatment of scoliosis, chest wall deformities, and joint problems
* Lifestyle Changes: avoid high intensity contact sports, maintain a health weight, and avoid smoking
