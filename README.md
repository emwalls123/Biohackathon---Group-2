# Disease: Marfan syndrome
Marfan Syndrome is an autosomal disorder that affects the skeletal, ocular, and   cardiovascular systems. Here is a breakdown of what it does within each of these systems:

Skeletal - scoliosis, chest wall deformity, tall stature, abnormal joint mobility

Ocular - ectopia lentis - condition characterized by the displacement or malposition of the eye's crystalline lens from its normal location. It can range from a partial dislocation (lens subluxation) to a complete dislocation (lens luxation), almost always bilateral in MFS

Cardiovascular system - progressive dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, causes aortic incompetence and dissection
Leading cause of premature death in MFS

# Underlying Gene: FBN1
